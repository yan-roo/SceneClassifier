## HW2: Celebrity face images generation

### Goals
Train your generative adversiral network to generat the celebrity face images as real as possible

### Description
- Download the dataset from code provide in [homework2.ipynb](https://github.com/NCTU-VRDL/CS_IOC5008/blob/master/HW2/homework2.ipynb)
- After trained your GAN, generated **500 images** (each image contains 3x3 grid of images) and save it by the "output_fig" function below, **Please note that the width, height of your image should be within the range [28, 112]**
```python
def output_fig(images_array, file_name="./results"):
    # the shape of your images_array should be (9, width, height, 3),  28 <= width, height <= 112 
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6), dpi=100)
    plt.imshow(helper.images_square_grid(images_array))
    plt.axis("off")
    plt.savefig(file_name+'.png', bbox_inches='tight', pad_inches=0)
```
- This homework will be evaluated by your classmates through voting for realistic (compare to baseline) in class
- Rank top3  will be invited to make a presentation to share your methodology and get a bonus on final score!

### Reports & Results submission
- Submit your results of images (by function we provide) and your reports to this [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/128HvF7a9WhxqBMo5EV70PDcLZy_4AvRr) inside the folder of your student ID
- Your reports (in PDF format) should include
  - GitHub/GitLab repository link
  - Introduction
  - Methodology (Data pre-process, Model architeture, Hyperparameters,...)
  - Findings or Summary
